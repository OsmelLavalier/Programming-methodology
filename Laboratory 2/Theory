* abstract classes is made by declaring at least one of its functions as pure virtual

* pure virtual function -> int GetArea() "= 0", writting the chars inside the strinng as follows.

* interface class (abstract base classes) cannot be instantiated: -> compiler error

* if one the class using the ABC class does not ovveride one of the pure virtual functions: -> compiler error

Rounded Rectangle Area:

   d = √(( a - 2r )² + ( b - 2r )²) + 2r
   p = 2 * [ a + b - r * ( 4 - π ) ]
   A = ab - r² * ( 4 - π )

Rectangle Area:
   A = w * h

Parallelepiped Area:
   A = 2(a·b + a·h + b·h)
   
Circle Area:
   A = πr² = π(R/2)²
   
Cylinder Area:
   v = πr²h
   ma (mantel arean) = 2πrh
   A = 2πrh + 2πr² = 2πr(h + r)
